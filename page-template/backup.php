				<p>For most individual investors looking to ‘do it themselves’, assembling a well-diversi ed investment portfolio can be time consuming and expensive. But at Luceo Asset Management, by starting with the advice process and matching your recommendation with the best investment manager, we make the process straightforward.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h3 class="yellow">ONGOING MANAGEMENT</h3>
				<p>Your investment managers don’t just build portfolios; they never stop working hard to make sure they keep performing. This means constantly monitoring investment markets, as well as extensively researching a vast number of different funds. You’ll be given regular updates on the performance of your portfolio so you can keep track of its progress.</p>
